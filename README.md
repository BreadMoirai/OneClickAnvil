# OneClickAnvil

This mod is clientside only.
To enable this mod, you must set an item id and rename value in the Mod settings.

In the anvil screen, you can shift click the first stack of that item into the input slot.
The mod will then rename the item and repeat this process for all remaining items of that type in your inventory.
It will ignore items that already have custom names.
  
### Dependencies 

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required.  
[ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) must be installed to configure the mod.
